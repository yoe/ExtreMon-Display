From the Extreme Monitoring Manifesto:

    Live, with Subsecond temporal resolution where possible, as fast as doesnâ€™t disrupt service, elsewhere
>>  Display on a meaningful representation, and in real-time.
    Simple Text-based Internet-Friendly Subscription Push API
    Implicit Provisioning (Test-driven infrastructure)
    Agent push the data as it is gathered
    Hot-pluggable components
    Re-use as many ubiquitous technologies as possible

Extremon-Display is an implementation of the second target: "Display on a meaningful representation, and in real-time"
